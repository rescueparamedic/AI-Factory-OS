# Technical Debt

## Approval Guardian v2

- Command classification is text-based. Shell syntax differs between Windows,
  POSIX shells, and tool-specific parsers; structured tool permissions should
  eventually replace text inference at execution boundaries.
- Existing subprocess and worker execution paths are not yet centrally routed
  through Guardian. Sprint AFDE-2.3 provides the stable policy API, CLI path,
  and adapter, but executor-by-executor enforcement remains future work.
- Symlink and junction containment depends on host filesystem resolution and
  should receive platform-specific integration coverage.
- Protected branches currently default to `main` and `master`; repository-host
  branch protection discovery is intentionally not fetched automatically.
- Audit files are local JSON records without locking, rotation, or a tamper-
  evident append-only store.
